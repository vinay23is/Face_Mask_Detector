# Face Mask Detection

This repository contains a Python script for detecting face masks using deep learning.

## Files in this Repository

- **`facemask.py`**: The main script that detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
- **`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`**: A pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier used for face detection.
- **`mymodel.h5`**: A trained deep learning model for classifying masked and unmasked faces.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file explaining the project.

## Features

- Detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not.
- Can be integrated with real-time video feeds.
- Uses OpenCV for face detection and a deep learning model for mask classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
